## 1. Brand Voice

### Core Voice Attributes

Our brand voice is built on four pillars:

**1. Professional**
We speak with authority. Our copy reflects deep expertise, not guesswork. We back claims with evidence, specifics, and clear reasoning.

**2. Confident**
We do not hedge or apologize. We state what we do, why it matters, and what the outcome will be. Confidence is not arrogance — it is earned through competence.

**3. Technical but Accessible**
We understand complex topics and translate them into clear, direct language. We do not dumb things down; we make them understandable. A business owner and a developer should both feel spoken to, not spoken at.

**4. Results-Oriented**
Every piece of copy connects back to an outcome. We do not describe features in isolation. We tie every capability to a measurable benefit.

### Voice in Practice

| Scenario                        | Weak                                               | Strong                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Describing a service            | "We can maybe help you with your website."         | "We build websites that load fast and convert visitors."      |
| Stating a benefit               | "This might improve your search rankings."         | "Our clients see an average 3x increase in organic traffic."  |
| Addressing a concern            | "SEO is really complicated and confusing."         | "SEO has many moving parts. We handle all of them."           |
| Making a recommendation         | "You should probably think about mobile design."   | "Mobile accounts for 65% of your traffic. We design for it first." |

### Vocabulary Standards

**Use:**
- Build, design, deliver, optimize, launch, grow, convert, measure, scale
- Clear, fast, reliable, proven, measurable, strategic
- "Your customers," "your business," "your goals"

**Avoid:**
- Leverage, synergy, disrupt, paradigm, holistic, revolutionary
- Superlatives without proof ("the best," "the greatest," "world-class")
- Jargon without explanation (do not assume the reader knows what "SSR" means unless writing for a technical audience)

---

## 2. Headline Formulas

Headlines do three jobs: capture attention, communicate value, and set expectations. Every headline should pass the "so what?" test — if a visitor reads it and thinks "so what?", it is not specific enough.

### Formula 1: [Outcome] + [Qualifier]

Focus on the result the reader wants, then add specificity.

- **Websites That Convert Visitors Into Customers**
- **SEO That Drives Revenue, Not Just Rankings**
- **Web Design Built for Speed and Growth**

### Formula 2: [Action Verb] + [Object] + [Benefit]

Lead with what we do, follow with why it matters.

- **Build a Website That Works as Hard as You Do**
- **Grow Your Organic Traffic With Data-Driven SEO**
- **Launch Your Brand With a Design System That Scales**

### Formula 3: [Problem] -> [Solution]

Name the pain, then position yourself as the answer.

- **Tired of a Slow Website? We Build for Performance First.**
- **Losing Leads to Poor UX? Let's Fix That.**
- **Your Competitors Are Ranking Above You. Here's How to Change That.**

### Formula 4: [Number/Stat] + [Claim]

Use real data to build credibility.

- **3x More Organic Traffic in 6 Months**
- **200ms Average Load Time Across Our Sites**
- **47 Businesses Launched With Our Platform This Year**

### Formula 5: [Question]

Pose a question the reader is already asking themselves.

- **Is Your Website Costing You Customers?**
- **What Would 3x More Leads Mean for Your Business?**
- **Ready to Stop Guessing and Start Growing?**

### Headline Rules

1. **Keep it under 10 words when possible.** Brevity forces clarity.
2. **One idea per headline.** Do not try to say everything at once.
3. **Use the reader's language.** "Get more customers" beats "optimize acquisition funnels."
4. **Be specific.** "Increase conversions by 40%" beats "improve your results."
5. **Avoid clickbait.** The headline must deliver on its promise in the content below.

## 3. CTA Copy Patterns

### Primary CTAs (High Commitment)

These drive the main conversion action: booking a call, requesting a quote, starting a project.

| Pattern                        | Example                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| [Get] + [Desired Outcome]      | Get Your Free SEO Audit          |
| [Start] + [Positive Action]    | Start Your Project               |
| [Book] + [Specific Next Step]  | Book a Strategy Call              |
| [Request] + [Deliverable]      | Request a Custom Proposal        |

### Secondary CTAs (Low Commitment)

These are for visitors not yet ready to convert. They build trust and keep the relationship alive.

| Pattern                            | Example                          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| [Learn/See] + [Topic]             | See Our Case Studies             |
| [Download] + [Resource]           | Download the SEO Checklist       |
| [Explore] + [Section]             | Explore Our Services             |
| [Read] + [Content]                | Read the Full Guide              |

### CTA Best Practices

1. **Use first person when addressing the user's benefit.** "Get My Free Audit" outperforms "Get Your Free Audit" on lead gen forms.
2. **One primary CTA per section.** Do not overwhelm with choices.
3. **Place CTAs after value has been established.** Explain the benefit, then ask for the action.
4. **Make the next step obvious.** "Book a 15-Minute Call" is clearer than "Contact Us."
5. **Add urgency only when genuine.** "Limited spots this month" works if true. Fake urgency erodes trust.

### CTA Microcopy

The small text near CTAs that reduces friction:

- "No commitment. No credit card required."
- "Takes less than 2 minutes."
- "We respond within 24 hours."
- "Join 500+ businesses who trust us."
- "Your information stays private."

## 4. Service Description Approach

### Structure for Every Service Page

Each service page follows this proven structure:

#### 1. Hero Section
- **Headline:** What we do + why it matters (Formula 1 or 2)
- **Subheadline:** One sentence expanding on the headline with specificity
- **Primary CTA:** Clear next step
- **Social proof element:** Client count, rating, or key metric

#### 2. Problem Statement
Name the pain the reader is experiencing. Be specific. Show that you understand their situation before you pitch a solution.

> "Your website loads in 6 seconds. Your bounce rate is 70%. You are paying for ads that lead to a page nobody trusts. The problem is not your product — it is your digital presence."

#### 3. Solution Overview
Explain what we do at a high level. Connect every capability to the reader's desired outcome.

#### 4. Process/How It Works
Break the service into 3-5 clear steps. This reduces anxiety by showing the reader exactly what to expect.

| Step | Name          | Description                                    |
| ---- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Discovery     | We learn your business, audience, and goals    |
| 2    | Strategy      | We define the approach, scope, and timeline    |
| 3    | Build         | We design and develop with regular check-ins   |
| 4    | Launch        | We deploy, test, and optimize                  |
| 5    | Grow          | We measure results and iterate                 |

#### 5. Features and Benefits
List capabilities in a two-column format: what it is and why it matters.

| Feature                     | Benefit                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Server-side rendering       | Faster load times and better search rankings     |
| Responsive design           | Works perfectly on every device your customers use|
| Conversion-optimized layout | More visitors become leads and customers          |
| Analytics integration       | You see exactly what is working and what is not  |

#### 6. Social Proof
- Testimonials from clients in this service area
- Case study summary with metrics
- Client logos

#### 7. FAQ
Answer the 4-6 most common objections or questions:
- "How long does this take?"
- "What does it cost?"
- "What do I need to provide?"
- "What happens after launch?"

#### 8. Final CTA
Restate the value proposition and present the primary CTA again.

### Writing Rules for Service Pages

- **Lead with outcomes, not features.** "Increase your organic traffic" not "We use Svelte and server-side rendering."
- **Quantify wherever possible.** Numbers build credibility.
- **Address objections proactively.** If price is a concern, frame the value. If timeline is a concern, set expectations.
- **Write in second person.** "You" and "your" keep the focus on the reader.

## 5. Case Study Framework

Case studies are proof. They turn abstract claims into concrete evidence.

### Structure: The CSOR Framework

**C — Challenge**
What problem did the client face? Be specific about the business impact.

> "Acme Corp's website took 8 seconds to load on mobile. Their bounce rate was 73%, and organic traffic had declined 40% over 12 months."

**S — Solution**
What did we do? Focus on the strategic approach, not just the technical details.

> "We rebuilt their site from scratch using SvelteKit with server-side rendering, optimized all images, implemented structured data, and launched a content strategy targeting their core service keywords."

**O — Outcome**
What measurable results did the client achieve? Use real numbers.

> "Within 6 months: page load time dropped to 1.2 seconds, organic traffic increased 280%, and monthly lead generation rose from 12 to 47."

**R — Reflection**
A brief client quote or our takeaway that reinforces the story.

> "The new site pays for itself every month. We should have done this two years ago." — Sarah Chen, CEO of Acme Corp

### Case Study Writing Rules

1. **Always lead with the result in the title.** "How Acme Corp Tripled Their Organic Traffic in 6 Months" not "Acme Corp Website Redesign."
2. **Use real numbers.** Percentages and absolute figures. "280% increase in organic traffic" and "from 12 to 47 leads per month."
3. **Keep it scannable.** Use headers, bold key metrics, and pull quotes.
4. **Include a clear before/after comparison.** Tables work well for this.
5. **End with a CTA.** "Want results like these? Book a strategy call."

### Metrics to Highlight

- Traffic growth (organic, total)
- Conversion rate change
- Lead volume change
- Revenue impact (if client permits)
- Page speed improvement
- Search ranking improvements
- Bounce rate reduction
- Time on site increase

## 6. Blog Structure

### Blog Post Template

Every blog post follows this structure for consistency and SEO performance.

#### Title
Use headline Formula 1, 2, or 4. Include the target keyword naturally.

#### Introduction (100-150 words)
- Hook: A surprising fact, question, or bold statement.
- Context: Why this topic matters right now.
- Promise: What the reader will learn or gain from this post.

#### Body (organized with H2 and H3 headers)
- Break content into logical sections with clear headers.
- Each section should deliver on a sub-topic.
- Use bullet points, numbered lists, and tables for scannability.
- Include relevant internal links to service pages and other posts.
- Use code examples where applicable.

#### Key Takeaways (bulleted summary)
- 3-5 bullet points summarizing the main lessons.
- Easy to skim for readers who scroll to the bottom.

#### CTA Section
- Related service page link.
- Lead magnet offer (if relevant).
- "Book a call" prompt for readers who want help.

### Blog Categories

Maintain a consistent taxonomy:

- **Technical Guides:** How-to content for developers and technical decision-makers.
- **Strategy:** Business-level thinking about web, SEO, and digital presence.
- **Case Studies:** Published in both `/case-studies` and cross-linked from `/blog`.
- **Industry Insights:** Trends, benchmarks, and analysis.

### Blog Writing Rules

1. **One target keyword per post.** Do not try to rank for everything.
2. **Front-load value.** The most important information goes first.
3. **Use headers as a table of contents.** A reader skimming the headers should understand the full article.
4. **Link to 2-3 internal pages per post.** Service pages, related posts, or resources.
5. **Link to 1-2 authoritative external sources.** This builds topical trust.
6. **Update published posts quarterly.** Fresh content ranks better.
7. **Minimum 1,500 words for pillar content.** 800 words for supporting posts.

## 7. Lead Magnet Copy

Lead magnets are free resources offered in exchange for contact information. The copy must make the value obvious and the commitment feel small.

### Lead Magnet Naming Formula

**[Adjective] + [Type] + [Specific Benefit]**

- The Ultimate SEO Checklist for Small Business Websites
- The 5-Minute Website Performance Audit Template
- The Complete Guide to Choosing a Web Design Agency
- Your Free Technical SEO Scorecard

### Landing Page Copy Structure

#### Headline
State what the reader gets and why it matters.

> "Download Our Free SEO Checklist — The Same One We Use With Every Client"

#### Subheadline
Add specificity and reduce skepticism.

> "47 actionable items covering technical SEO, content, and performance. No fluff."

#### Bullet Points (What's Inside)
List 4-6 specific things they will learn or receive:

- The 10 technical SEO fixes that impact rankings the most
- A page-by-page content audit template
- Core Web Vitals benchmarks and how to hit them
- A prioritized action plan you can implement this week
- The exact tools we recommend (most are free)

#### Social Proof
- "Downloaded by 1,200+ business owners"
- Client testimonial about the resource

#### Form
Keep it minimal. Name and email are sufficient for most lead magnets. Every additional field reduces conversion.

#### Privacy Assurance
"We respect your inbox. No spam, ever. Unsubscribe anytime."

### Lead Magnet Copy Rules

1. **Be specific about what they get.** "47-item checklist" beats "comprehensive resource."
2. **Emphasize immediacy.** "Download instantly" or "Get it in your inbox in 60 seconds."
3. **Match the magnet to the service.** An SEO checklist should lead to SEO service conversations.
4. **Do not oversell.** If it is a one-page checklist, do not call it "The Ultimate Guide."

## 8. SEO Copywriting

SEO copywriting is writing for humans first and search engines second. The goal is content that ranks AND converts.

### Keyword Placement

Place the target keyword in these locations:

| Location              | Priority | Notes                                    |
| --------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Title tag             | Required | Within the first 60 characters           |
| H1                    | Required | Should match or closely mirror the title |
| First 100 words       | Required | Include naturally in the opening         |
| URL slug              | Required | Use the keyword or close variant         |
| Meta description      | Required | Include for bold text in SERPs           |
| H2/H3 headers         | High     | Use variations and related terms         |
| Image alt text        | High     | Describe the image with keyword context  |
| Body copy             | Medium   | 2-4 natural occurrences per 1000 words   |
| Internal link anchors | Medium   | Use keyword-rich anchor text             |

### Keyword Density

Do not chase a specific percentage. Write naturally. If the keyword appears 3-5 times in a 1,500-word article and the content thoroughly covers the topic, that is sufficient.

### Semantic SEO

Search engines understand topics, not just exact keywords. Cover related concepts:

- For "web design services": also discuss UX, responsive design, conversion optimization, page speed, mobile design.
- For "SvelteKit SEO": also discuss server-side rendering, meta tags, structured data, Core Web Vitals, static generation.

### Title Tag Formulas

- **[Primary Keyword]: [Value Proposition]** — "Web Design Services: Sites That Convert"
- **[Primary Keyword] for [Audience]** — "SEO Services for Small Businesses"
- **[Number] [Primary Keyword] [Qualifier]** — "7 Technical SEO Fixes That Actually Work"
- **How to [Primary Keyword] [Outcome]** — "How to Improve Page Speed Without Rebuilding Your Site"

### Meta Description Formulas

Keep under 155 characters. Include the target keyword and a clear value proposition.

- "Custom web design services that convert visitors into customers. Fast, responsive, and built for growth. Get a free consultation today."
- "Learn the 10 technical SEO fixes that have the biggest impact on rankings. Free checklist included."

## 9. Tone Guidelines: Do's and Don'ts

### Do's

- **Do be direct.** Say what you mean in as few words as possible.
- **Do use active voice.** "We build websites" not "Websites are built by us."
- **Do write in second person.** "You" makes the reader the protagonist.
- **Do back claims with evidence.** Numbers, examples, case studies.
- **Do use short sentences and paragraphs.** Web readers scan. Help them.
- **Do match tone to context.** Blog posts can be slightly more conversational. Service pages stay professional.
- **Do use contractions.** "We're" and "you'll" are fine. They sound natural.
- **Do acknowledge complexity.** "SEO has a lot of moving parts — here's how we simplify it."
- **Do write for the reader's benefit.** Every paragraph should answer "what's in it for me?"
- **Do edit ruthlessly.** Cut every word that does not serve a purpose.

### Don'ts

- **Don't use buzzwords.** "Leverage synergies" means nothing. Say what you actually do.
- **Don't hedge.** "We think we might be able to help" sounds uncertain. "We can help" is confident.
- **Don't use passive voice unnecessarily.** "Mistakes were made" is weak. "We made a mistake" is honest.
- **Don't exaggerate.** "The best agency in the world" is unverifiable and sounds desperate.
- **Don't use ALL CAPS or excessive exclamation marks.** Confidence does not require shouting.
- **Don't talk about yourself first.** Lead with the reader's problem, not your resume.
- **Don't assume technical knowledge.** Define terms or link to explanations.
- **Don't write walls of text.** Break up long sections with headers, lists, and whitespace.
- **Don't use filler phrases.** "In order to" can be "to." "At this point in time" can be "now."
- **Don't be condescending.** "It's actually quite simple" implies the reader should already know.

### Filler Phrases to Eliminate

| Instead of                    | Write                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| In order to                   | To                   |
| At this point in time         | Now                  |
| Due to the fact that          | Because              |
| In the event that             | If                   |
| It is important to note that  | (delete entirely)    |
| As a matter of fact           | (delete entirely)    |
| Each and every                | Every                |
| For the purpose of            | To / For             |
| In the near future            | Soon                 |
| A large number of             | Many                 |

- Friendly message: "This page doesn't exist, but we do."
- Search bar or suggested links
- Link to homepage, services, and blog
- Do NOT use `index, follow` — always `noindex`.
